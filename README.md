### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**tiegz/tiegz** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Tidelift
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swift
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting OSS projects, and/or possibly XR games or language-learning tools.
