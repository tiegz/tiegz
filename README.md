### Ahoy 🤝

- 🔭 I work at Tidelift, helping build a system that pays OSS maintainers, and improves open-source software security.
- 🌱 Lately I've been writing: Ruby, TypeScript, Go, and C.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting OSS projects, and/or possibly XR games or language-learning tools.
