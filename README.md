### Ahoy 🤝

- 🔭 I work at Tidelift, helping build a system that pays OSS maintainers and that improves open-source software security.
- 🌱 In 2024 I've been writing: Ruby, Go, C, MASM, and TypeScript.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting OSS projects, and/or possibly XR games or language-learning tools.
